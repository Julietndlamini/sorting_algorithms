Sorting Algorithms
This is a team project for C programming, that will help us understand the sorting of algorithm of different type and to be able to evaluate or determine the big O notations of the time complexity of each sort algorithm:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
In this project, we also learned how to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
